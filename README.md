# Computer Vision Assignment 3

This project explores computer vision concepts using OpenCV. It covers:

- Adding noise to images  
- Applying filters (median, Gaussian, smoothing)  
- Thresholding (all methods available in OpenCV)  
- Non-affine transformations to correct skewed or deformed images and map them onto a rectangular frame  

## Project Structure

- `images/` – contains input images (some are also downloaded directly from the web)  
- `results/` – stores output images generated by the scripts/notebooks  
- `requirements.txt` – lists dependencies for reproducibility  
- `.devcontainer/` – configuration to ensure consistent environment setup  
- Jupyter notebooks / Python scripts – each includes an initialization cell for reproducibility  

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```
git clone &lt;repo-url&gt;  
cd &lt;repo-name&gt;  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Using Devcontainers

If you are using VS Code with the Remote Containers extension, you can open the project inside a devcontainer:

```
# In VS Code
Ctrl+Shift+P → "Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container..."
```

This ensures the same environment and reproducibility across different systems.
